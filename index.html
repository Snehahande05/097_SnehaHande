            <p>
              Rani Lakshmi Bai, also known as the Queen of Jhansi, was a fearless leader and a symbol of resistance 
              against British colonial rule in India. Born on 19 November 1828 as Manikarnika Tambe, she became queen 
              after marrying the Maharaja of Jhansi. She played a key role in the Indian Rebellion of 1857 and died 
              fighting on the battlefield in 1858, becoming a legend of Indian history.
